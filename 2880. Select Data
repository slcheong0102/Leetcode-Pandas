Import pandas:

import pandas as pd
This line imports the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
Define the function:

def selectData(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
The function selectData is defined with one parameter students. The type hint suggests that students should be a pandas DataFrame.
The function returns a pandas DataFrame, as indicated by the type hint -> pd.DataFrame.
Filter and Select Data:

return students.loc[students["student_id"] == 101, ["name", "age"]]
The loc accessor is used to filter and select data based on label indexing.
students["student_id"] == 101 creates a boolean mask where the condition is true for rows where student_id is 101.
students.loc[students["student_id"] == 101, ["name", "age"]] filters the DataFrame to include only the rows where student_id is 101 and selects only the name and age columns.
Summary:
The function takes a pandas DataFrame and returns a new DataFrame filtered by student_id equal to 101.
It selects only the name and age columns for the filtered rows.
The loc accessor is used for label-based indexing to filter and select the data.
